In this assignment you will implement the basic methods involved in 2D graphics. 
The focus will be mostly on implementing filters that take an input image, process it, 
and produces a modified output image.

What You Have To Do:
The following is a list of features that you may implement (roughly by difficulty). The number in front corresponds to how many points the feature is worth:
• (1) Brighten: This filter is done for you and you can use it as a starting point.
• (3) Random noise: Add noise to an image.
• (3) Crop: Extract a subimage specified by a corner and area.
• (3) Extract Channel: Leave specified channel intact and set all others to zero.
• (3) Contrast: Change the contrast of an image.
• (3) Saturation: Change the saturation of an image.
• (4) Sharpen: Sharpen an image by extrapolating from a blurred version.
• (5) Quantize: Change the number of bits per channel of an image, using
simple rounding.
• (5) Random dither: Convert an image to a given number of bits per channel,
using a randomized threshold.
• (10) Blur: Blur an image by convolving it with a Gaussian low-pass filter.
• (10) Edge detect: Detect edges in an image by convolving it with an edge
detection kernel.
• (10) Ordered dither: Convert an image to a given number of bits per channel,
using a 4x4 ordered dithering matrix.
• (10) Floyd-Steinberg dither: Convert an image to a given number of bits per
channel, using dithering with error diffusion.
• (10) Scale: Scale an image up or down in size by a real valued factor.
• (10) Rotate: Rotate an image by a given angle.
• (10) Fun: Warp an image using a non-linear mapping of your choice
(examples are fisheye, sine, bulge, swirl).
