- Limitation of current implementation:
	- only support spheres
	- max number of spheres is capped to 50
	- spot light, directional light and other advanced feature not supported
	- lighting is not perfect- need to spend more time debugging. Most probably some normal calc is a bit off.


How to run?

- $make build
- $ ./a.out <scn_filename> # Ex: ./a.out spheres1.scn
