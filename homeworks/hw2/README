In this assignment, you will create a simple ray-tracing application capable of rendering scenes 
consisting of spheres lit by point light sources. Scenes will be described in a simple, easy to 
parse text specification file. This is part 1 of a two-part assignment. In the second part you 
will extend this raytracer to incorporate triangle meshes, more complex lighting, and other extensions 
for more realistic images.
