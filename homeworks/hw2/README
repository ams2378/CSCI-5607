In this assignment, you will create a simple ray-tracing application capable of rendering scenes 
consisting of spheres lit by point light sources. Scenes will be described in a simple, easy to 
parse text specification file. This is part 1 of a two-part assignment. In the second part you 
will extend this raytracer to incorporate triangle meshes, more complex lighting, and other extensions 
for more realistic images.

Assignment Requirements:
As this is a two-part assignment, Part 1 will be graded out of 50 pts. The number is front is how many points the feature is worth. Partial credit will be given to features that “mostly” work. The required minimum feature set is underlined.

(5) Camera placement, film resolution, aspect ratio (5) User specified background colors
(5) UI + OpenGL output
(5) BMP or PNG output
    
Primitives:
(5) Spheres
(5) Difference/Intersection of spheres (Constructive Solid Geometry)
Lighting:
(5) Ambient lights
(5) Point light sources

Sampling:
(5) Basic Sampling
(5) Jittered Supersampling (5) Adaptive Supersampling (5) Motion Blur
