This assignment is intended to be a gentle introduction to graphics programming. 
The goal is to write a very simple application that uses the basic features of the OpenGL, 
and some simple interaction with what is drawn on the screen. The application will draw a 
single square in the center of a window, and should allow a user to resize, move and rotate 
this square. The color of the square should optionally change based on the keyboard input.

Basic Features (75 points):
• Installing all libraries.
• Drawing a square that moves when the user clicks a drags their mouse.
Required Features (20 points):
• (5) Translating only when the user drags on the square's interior (not the edge or outside the square)
• (5) Scaling the square when the user drags on the edges
• (10) Rotating the square when the user drags on the corners
Extra Features:
(5) Changing something visually when the user presses the keyboard (10) Texturing the square
(10) Supporting both a square and triangle
(5) Graphical indicator of what motion is being performed.
(5) Animating the square on it’s own
(5) Multiple squares
(5) Maintaining the square’s shape when the window aspect ratio changes
